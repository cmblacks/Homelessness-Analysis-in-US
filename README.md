# **About My Tableau Project**

My project focuses on analyzing homelessness trends in the United States, with a particular emphasis on year-over-year changes in the availability of shelter beds and housing resources. The primary dataset includes variables such as the number of year-round shelter beds, types of housing (Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, Safe Haven, etc.), and bed availability over multiple years (e.g., 2016 and 2023). Using Tableau, my goal is to visualize the changes in bed capacity across different Continuums of Care (CoCs) and understand the overall growth or decline in available resources for homeless populations. A key calculation in my project is the percentage change in total year-round beds between 2016 and 2023, which helps reveal which areas have seen an increase or decrease in capacity.

By breaking down the data by region or CoC, my analysis also explores geographic disparities in bed availability, offering a comprehensive view of how homelessness resources have evolved over time. My project aims to hopefully help inform decision-makers such as lawmakers, government agencies, and non-profits on the effectiveness of resource allocation and help guide future efforts in addressing homelessness in the U.S.

## **About My Dataset** 

My dataset was located on the HUD Exchange website. Housing and Urban Development is what the HUD Exchange is focused on.   In essence, they work to lessen all housing-related worries and problems, such homelessness and housing affordability in the US. Point-in-Time (PIT) estimates of homelessness by state and Continuum of Care (CoC) geographic service area, as well as estimates of chronic homelessness since 2007, are available in raw datasets on the HUD Exchange. Veterans that are homeless are estimated starting in 2011. The project-level Housing Inventory Count (HIC) file for the current year is also accessible, as are the supporting HIC data by CoC and state.

## **Any Future Work**

At this moment I have no future work planned for my data and project. I would love to work with communities and other states/cities to figure out how to reduce homelessness within the United states.
