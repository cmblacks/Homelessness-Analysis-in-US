# **About my Tableau Project**

My project focuses on analyzing homelessness trends in the United States, with a particular emphasis on year-over-year changes in the availability of shelter beds and housing resources. The primary dataset includes variables such as the number of year-round shelter beds, types of housing (Emergency Shelters, Transitional Housing, Safe Haven, etc.), and bed availability over multiple years (e.g., 2016 and 2023). Using Tableau, my goal is to visualize the changes in bed capacity across different Continuums of Care (CoCs) and understand the overall growth or decline in available resources for homeless populations. A key calculation in my project is the percentage change in total year-round beds between 2016 and 2023, which helps reveal which areas have seen an increase or decrease in capacity.

By breaking down the data by region or CoC, my analysis also explores geographic disparities in bed availability, offering a comprehensive view of how homelessness resources have evolved over time. My project aims to hopefully help inform decision-makers such as lawmakers, government agencies, and non-profits on the effectiveness of resource allocation and help guide future efforts in addressing homelessness in the U.S.
